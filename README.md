# NLPClassifiers

This project aims at investigating different Neural Language model approaches to user intent classification in Noisy Texts. 

The *nlpClassifiers* library implements the dataset reader and the models used in the BOW, LSTM, and BERT for features extraction classifiers. The library can be installed with `pip install -e .` from the root directory.
